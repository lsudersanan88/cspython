"""
These problems are representative of questions that will be on exam 1.

YOU WILL NOT HAVE INTERNET ACCESS OR REFERENCE MATERIALS FOR THE EXAM! This means,
if you find yourself using the lecture notes or stack overflow when solving these problems,
you are not prepared for the exam. Remember, it is not enough to 'understand' the solution,
you must also be able to produce it without aid.

FAQ:

Q: Will you accept _____ as correct output? or do you prefer _______?
A: These are ungraded questions, the important skill is being capable of doing both solutions.

Q: I solved these problems, do you have any more?
A: There is much to be gained from solving these questions multiple times. But yes, there will be more practice problems with the next lecture.

Q: Are you planning on posting any solutions?
A: No, but you are free to get feedback on your code during class time from myself or your peers.

Q: My solution is 'similar' to one commonly found online...
A: Ok
