## Declaring variables

# # Pointers?
# x = 10
# y = x
# x = 'hello'
#
# print(x)
# print(y)


# # but what about objects? Here we use lists (arrays)
# x = [1, 2, 3]
# y = x
# x.append(4)
#
# print(x)
# print(y)


# # commas in declarations
# x, y = False, True
#
# print(x)
# print(y)


# # multiple assignments
# x = y = None
#
# print(x)
# print(y)



## String formating

# # this is the best way, use .format()
# x = True
# y = 'The value of x is: {}'.format(x)
#
# print(y)
#
#
# # python 3.6 supports fstrings, which are better... but you can't use this on your exam! and this will crash older versions of python
# x = False
# y = f'The value of x is: {x}'
#
# print(y)
#
#
# # the old-school and ugly way, you may see this, but don't write it
# x = 'Tuesday'
# y = 'The value of x is: %s'%(x)
#
# print(y)



# # Functions are objects and can be assigned!
# def triple(i):
#     return i*3
#
# x = triple
#
# print(triple(10))
# print(x(10))


# # Don't overwrite built in functions! Python will let you
# x = y = 10.09
#
# x = int(x)
# print(x)
#
# int = triple
# y = int(y)
# print(y)



## Conditional Statements: IF, ASSERT

# # if, elif, else
# x = 10
#
# if x > 100:
#     print('x is large')
# elif x == 10 :
#     print('x is exactly 10')
# else:
#     print('x is small')


# # not everything needs a comparison (>, <, ==)
# x = None
#
# if x:
#     print('x is not None')
# else:
#     print('x is None')


# # DANGER! 0 == false! This could be a debugging nightmare if you don't know!
# x = 0
# if x:
#     print('x is not None')
# else:
#     print('x is None')


# # ASSERT is used mostly for testing
# x = 0
# assert x == 1, 'x is not 1'


# # this is similar to
# if x != 1:
#     raise AssertionError('x is not 1')

# # try/except work similar to if/else statements
# x = 'yes'
# try:
#     x = int(x)
# except:
#     print('cannot convert to int')
#     exit(1)



## Loops: FOR, WHILE

# # use the range(10) function, instead of: i=0, i<10, i++
# for i in range(10):
#     print(i)


# # range(start, stop, step)
# for i in range(20, 30, 2):
#     print(i)


# # while loops
# i = 0
# while i < 10:
#     print(i)
#     i += 1  # not i++


# skip to the next iteration of a loop with CONTINUE
# for i in range(100):
#     if i%2 == 0:
#         continue
#     print(i)


# exit a loop entierly with BREAK
# for i in range(5):
#     for j in range(1000000000000000000000000000000000000):
#         if j > 3:
#             break
#         print(i,j)


# # looping over arrays is easy
# x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# for i in x:
#     print(i)


# # use enumerate to loop over an iterable and count each loop
x = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four','four']
for i, word in enumerate(x):
     print(i, word)


# # use zip() to loop over two iterables, it will always stop at the shorter of the two
x = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
y = ['even', 'odd']
#
# for a, b in zip(x, y):
#     print(a, b)



## Definitions: we will discuss generators, *args, and **kwargs after exam 2
# def dbl(x):
#     return x*2
#
# print(dbl(3))


# some defs are built in
# help()
